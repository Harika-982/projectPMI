Determining the postmortem interval PMI or time  of death is a critical step in forensic investigations.
The present project outlines a  concept of a device that can be used in the prediction of the  PMI through providing the profile of different metabolites in  blood such as Lactate dehydrogenase LDH, Aspartate  aminotransferase AST, triglycerides and cholesterols.
In  addition to the measurement of blood pH. Use of these  biochemical markers could be promising tools in forensic  death investigations.
